## What is useRef?

The `useRef` hook is a built-in hook in React that provides a way to create and maintain a reference to a specific element or value within a component. It returns a mutable ref object that can access the underlying DOM element or value and persists between re-renders of the component.

```javascript
{ current: ReactElementReference }
```

This hook can be beneficial in a situation where values frequently change. If we use `useState` to store it will render on every change but `useRef` will persist in its value and will avoid unnecessary rerenders.

## Use Cases of useRef.

1. It can be used to store and update mutable information without triggering re-renders all the time.
    
2. It can be used to access DOM nodes via refs to perform some functions on them.
    

## Use Case 1: Storing & updating the mutable value.

`useRef` can be used to store mutable values that persist between re-renders of a component. Unlike `useState` changes to the value stored in a ref object do not trigger a re-render of the component. This can be useful for storing values that need to be accessed or modified by multiple parts of a component, without triggering unnecessary re-renders.

```javascript
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const counterRef = useRef(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      counterRef.current++;
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Counter: {counterRef.current}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we create a ref object `counterRef` using `useRef`, and initialize it to 0. We then use the `useEffect` hook to start an interval that increments the value stored in `counterRef.current` every second. Since changes to `counterRef.current` do not trigger a re-render, the counter updates smoothly without causing unnecessary re-renders.

## Use Case 2: Accessing the DOM element.

Another use case for `useRef` is to access a DOM element within a component. You can create a ref object using `useRef`, then pass it to the `ref` attribute of the DOM element you want to reference. Once the component is mounted, you can access the underlying DOM element using the `current` property of the ref object.

```javascript
import { useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  const handleClick = () => {
    myRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" ref={myRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus Input</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we create a ref object `myRef` using `useRef`, and pass it to the `ref` attribute of the input element. We also define a `handleClick` function that accesses the input element using `myRef.current` and calls the `focus()` method on it when the button is clicked.

Some other use cases where we can use `useRef` :

1. UnControlled Forms.
    
2. Scrolling to a specific section of the page.
