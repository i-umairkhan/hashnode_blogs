## What is useReducer?

The `useReducer` hook is a built-in React hook that allows you to manage the state and update it using a reducer function. It is an alternative to using the `useState` hook for managing a more complex state that requires multiple actions and changes.

## useReducer Arguments.

The `useReducer` hook takes two arguments:

1. **A reducer function:** Used to update state values.
    
2. **An initial state value:** This is the initial value of the state.
    

```javascript
useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });
```

## Return Values.

The `useReducer` hook returns an array with two values:

1. The current state value.
    
2. **A dispatch function:** This function is used to update the state. It takes an action object as an argument and calls the reducer function to calculate the new state.
    

```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });
```

## Reducer Function.

The reducer function takes two arguments, the current state and an action object, and returns the new state. The reducer function should be a pure function, meaning that it should not modify the original state and should always return a new state.

```javascript
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 }; 
      // return { count: count++ }; -> Error cannot directly modify state or can have side effects in reducers
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}
```

## Example.

```javascript
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>
        +
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>
        -
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `reducer` function takes the current `state` and an `action` object, and returns the new state based on the action type. The `Counter` component uses the `useReducer` hook to manage the `count` state, and uses the `dispatch` function to update the state based on the button click events.

## Payload.

What if we want a custom value for our `count` . In that case we can pass `payload` to our `dispatch` which will be set to `count` .

```javascript
// Reducer
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'set':
      return { count: action.payload };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}
```

```javascript
// form
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
    <input type="number" value={value} onChange={handleChange}/>
    <button type="submit">Set Count</button>
</form>
```

```javascript
// handle functions 
 const handleChange = (event) => {
    setValue(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    dispatch({ type: 'set', payload: parseInt(value) });
    setValue('');
  };
```

When the `dispatch` function is called with the `set` action type and `payload`, the reducer function updates the `count` state to the new value provided by the user.
