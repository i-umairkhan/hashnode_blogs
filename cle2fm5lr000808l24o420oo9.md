# useState - React Hooks

### What is useState?

The `useState` hook in React is a built-in hook that allows you to add a state to your functional components.

The state is a way to store and manage data that can change in your component, and it's an essential concept in React that allows you to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const App = () =>  {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the above example, we are using the `useState` hook to declare a state variable called `count`, which we initialize to 0. The `useState` hook returns an array with two elements: the current value of the state, and a function that allows you to update the state. We destructure this array into `count` and `setCount`, respectively.

The component displays the current `count` and a button. When the button is clicked, we call `setCount` and pass in a new value for the `count` (the current `count` plus 1). This updates the state and triggers a re-render of the component, which causes the updated `count` to be displayed on the page.

### Passing function to setter function.

When you pass a function to `setCount` instead of directly updating the state, the React framework can schedule the state updates and ensure that they're performed consistently, even when multiple updates are happening at the same time. This can help prevent race conditions and ensure that your state updates are performed correctly, even in complex scenarios.

Here's an example of why you might use a function to update the state:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const App = () =>  {  
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the above example, when the button is clicked, we call `handleClick`, which calls `setCount`and passes a function that takes the previous value of `count` and returns the new value (the previous value of `count` plus 1). This allows us to perform the state update predictably, even when multiple updates are happening at the same time.

Passing a function to `setState` is a common pattern in React and is often used to update states consistently and predictably.

### Arrays and Objects as State.

When the state is initialized `const [count,setCount] = useState(0)` we use const. This means that we cannot directly modify `count=10` it because it is constant. So we have to use the setter function `setName(10)`. But what if we have an array as the initial state `const [myArray, setMyArray] = useState(['a', 'b'])` and we needed to push an element to the array? We cannot directly modify the array as `myArray.push('c')` . So we use the setter function as `setMyArray(myArray => [...myArray, 'c'])` . Here we are passing a function to the setter function that will return a new array with all previous elements plus `'c'` added and will be set to `myArray` . This same syntax applyes to objects.

### Redring Problems.

1. Components re-rerender themselves when the state is updated. If we are storing a value of the variable in the state that is being updated frequently then it might cause performance problems because the component will re-render itself whenever the state changes. This problem can be solved using `useMemo` hook.
    
2. Suppose we have a state `const [name,setName] = useState("Umair")` at first, the name will have an initial value of `umair` and suppose that it is updated after some time `setName("Khan")` now component will re-render itself it will ignore the initial argument of `umair` and will assign the most recently updated value in `name` that will be `khan`.
    
    A problem might occur hear is when we have an expensive computational function being passed as the initial value of our state `const [value,setValue] = useState(someExpensiveFunction())`. `someExpensiveFunction()` function will run for initial `value`. Suppose after some time state is changed `setValue(10)` . Hear state is changed and is assigned to `10` but that `someExpensiveFunction()` is present in our component and will run every time the state will change & the component will re-render even if we are not using that function. This will affect our component performance.
    
    This problem can be solved by the lazy initial state which means the function will only execute once.
    
    ```javascript
    const [value,setValue] = useState(() => { 
    const initial  = someExpensiveFunction();
    return initial;
    )
    ```
    
    This lazy initial state will ensure that the function will run once for state initialization & will not run when the state changes.
